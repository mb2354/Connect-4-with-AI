# AI-Powered Connect 4 Game

## Description
This project is an implementation of the classic Connect 4 game powered by an artificial intelligence (AI) that can play against human players. The AI uses strategic moves based on the current state of the game to challenge players.

## Installation
To run this game, you will need Java installed on your machine.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using: 
   git clone [https://github.com/mb2354/Connect-4-with-AI]

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and compile the Java files: 

  javac Connect4.java AIPlayer.java Connect4App.java

3. Run the application:

java Connect4App

## Usage
Start the game by running the Connect4App class. The game will prompt you to select whether to play against another human or against the AI. The game follows standard Connect 4 rules where the first player to align four of their tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.
